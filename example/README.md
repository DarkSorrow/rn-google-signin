This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:

### Now what?

- If you want to add this new React Native code to an existing application, check out the [Integration guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps).

# Google Sign-In (Android)

This example uses **Credential Manager** for sign-in. Even if your device has a Google account and other apps can sign in, **this app** must be registered in Google Cloud with its own Android OAuth client.

1. **Get this app’s SHA-1** (debug build):
   ```sh
   cd android && ./gradlew signingReport
   ```
   Or with keytool:
   ```sh
   keytool -list -v -keystore app/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
   ```
   Copy the **SHA-1** from the output.

2. **In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)** (same project as your Web client ID):
   - **Create credentials** → **OAuth client ID**
   - Application type: **Android**
   - Name: e.g. `RnGoogleSignin Example (Debug)`
   - Package name: **`novasteraoss.rngooglesignin.example`**
   - SHA-1: paste the fingerprint from step 1
   - Create

3. Use the **same Web client ID** in the app as you use for your other clients (already in `App.tsx`). No need to create a new Web client; the Android client just links this app’s package + SHA-1 to your project so Credential Manager can offer sign-in.

If you see “No Google account found” or `NoCredentialException` despite having an account on the device, the usual cause is a missing or wrong Android OAuth client for this package name and SHA-1.
